# Thundershock Engine

Work-in-progress game engine written because I want to.

## Goals

This engine has a few notable goals I'd like to accomplish.

 - **To learn:** I'd like to learn how to use WebGPU.
 - **To prove .NET can handle game engines:** We don't need C++, we don't need Rust.
 - **To be simple and usable:** You should be able to make a game with this engine without needing to take a course to learn its UI or API.

## Building

Build the `Thundershock.Editor` project, this is the project that you use to actually make a game. To play an already-made game, build and run the `Thundershock.Player` application. It looks for built game data in the current directory where the binary was run.

## Creating a project

As with many game engines, Thundershock has a project system. It doesn't exist yet, so this section is to be determined.
